Cost-of-living payments: Latest £300 instalment being paid from now,[],,0.9983,Uplifting,"Cost-of-living payments: Latest £300 instalment being paid from now Published 1 hour ago

Millions of low-income households across the UK are starting to receive the latest instalment of cost-of-living payments from Tuesday.

Eight million people on means-tested benefits, such as Universal Credit, will receive £300 directly by 19 November, without the need to make a claim.

It is the second of three instalments that will eventually total £900.

All will be paid directly into eligible recipients' bank accounts, and people are being warned about scammers using the situation to try to trick people into handing over personal information.

A committee of MPs is currently investigating whether the payments are supporting those most in need.

What cost-of-living payments are available?

Some groups are receiving payments to help with higher bills, including:

£900 in total in three instalments. One was paid in spring with the next paid by 19 November and then another in spring 2024 to households on means-tested benefits

£300 for pensioner households in the winter

£150 to people on certain disability benefits has been paid

The first instalment of £301 for those on means-tested benefits was received by about eight million people in late April and June. The next of £300 is being paid between 31 October and 19 November.

Who is eligible for the £900 payment?

The payment, in three instalments, is available to households who receive the following benefits:

Universal credit

Income-based jobseeker's allowance

Income-related employment and support allowance

Income support

Working tax credit

Child tax credit

Pension credit

The payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their national insurance number, followed by DWP COL.

The 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits, are paid slightly later than others.

People are not eligible for these payments if they receive the new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or the new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit.

Anyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, or report it here.

To qualify for the latest instalment, people had to have claimed a benefits payment between 18 August and 17 September, or received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated.

An estimated 850,000 pensioner households do not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments.

Other eligibility details are outlined here.

None of these cost-of-living payments affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive.

What help are disabled people getting?

Up to six million people on the following disability benefits received another £150:

Disability living allowance

Personal independence payment

Attendance allowance

Scottish disability payments

Armed Forces independence payment

Constant attendance allowance

War pension mobility supplement

Those payments were made between 20 June and 4 July.

What help are pensioners getting?

Households that receive the winter fuel payment - which is worth £200-£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra £300 in November or December 2022, and will get another £300 this coming winter.

Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits.

What cost-of-living payments have people already received?

Two payments totalling £650 were made in 2022 to more than eight million low-income households.

Payments of £300 were also paid to pensioners during last winter, and a £150 payment was also made to those with disabilities.

Some people would have received all of those payments, if they were eligible.

What other support have people had?

A £150 rebate, often through people's council tax bill, was made last year. The Household Support Fund, which is distributed by local councils, helped vulnerable people, including giving fuel vouchers to those in need.

All household energy bills were cut by at least £400 between October and March.

The discount was made automatically by energy suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales. However, there are no plans to repeat this in the coming winter.

Separate arrangements were made for households in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.

They received a single payment of £600 starting in January, which was more than in the rest of the UK because a higher proportion of households use heating oil.

Direct debit customers in Northern Ireland had the money paid into their bank accounts. Other customers were sent a voucher.

What is the inquiry by MPs all about?

The Commons Work and Pensions Committee is investigating whether cost-of-living payments have been received by those in most need of help.

They are studying whether some have missed out on hundreds of pounds because they are just outside the qualifying criteria, and whether the package as a whole is sufficient for low-income families.

What else is the government doing to tackle energy prices?

The government launched an Energy Price Guarantee in October 2022, which limited a typical dual-fuel household's annual energy bill to £2,500 throughout last winter.

The scheme, which applied to England, Wales and Scotland, is still in place if needed, but has not been required since July.

What about help for businesses?

A government scheme to cut energy bills for businesses finished at the end of March.

Under a new scheme that began in April, firms get a discount on wholesale prices rather than costs being capped as under the previous deal.

Heavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, get a larger discount than others.

Paris Masters: Andy Murray says he is 'not enjoying' tennis after opening round Alex de Minaur loss,[],,-0.2375,Sad,"Last updated on .From the section Tennis

De Minaur knocked Murray out in the first round of the China Open in Beijing last month

Andy Murray says he is ""not enjoying"" his tennis after suffering an agonising opening-round defeat by Australian Alex de Minaur at the Paris Masters.

The 36-year-old fell 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-5 to the world number 13, who he has never managed to beat in six meetings.

Murray twice served for the match and missed match point in another gruelling contest lasting just over three hours.

""I'm not really enjoying it just now in terms of how I feel on the court and how I'm playing,"" Murray said.

""The last five, six months haven't been that enjoyable, so I need to try and find some of that enjoyment back because playing a match like that there's not much positivity there.

""When I play a good point, I'm not really getting behind myself and then in the important moments, that will to win and fight that has always been quite a big, big part of my game,"" he added.

Murray smashed his racquet twice during the match against De Minaur and the loss means the Scot has still not won a match at the Paris Masters since winning the tournament in 2016.

Despite his negativity, Murray did not give any indication that he could retire but said he would need to do ""a lot of work"" if he wants to keep playing.

""It's not just going to be like one or two weeks of training to get me to where I need to get to, it's going to have to be a lot of work and consistent work to give myself a chance,"" he added.

Murray, who has lost five of his last six matches, failed to convert three match points against De Minaur in Beijing last month and this latest loss in Paris is his fourth against the 24-year-old this year.

His opponent saved set points before pinching a close opening set with a narrow tie-break victory.

Murray recovered with a more assured performance in the second, breaking in the ninth game to level and force a decider.

Murray's record against De Minaur this year also includes defeats at Monte Carlo and Queen's, but it looked like the former world number one might break that losing streak after finding himself a double break up in the deciding set.

He had match point at 5-4 but missed it with a long return and smashed his racquet on the floor in anger after handing De Minaur a break-point opportunity, which he took to level at 5-5.

Murray became increasingly exasperated as he knocked the drinks bottles and towel off his bench before failing to hold either of his next two service games and squandering opportunities to force a final set tie-break.

He again smashed his racquet on the floor as he sent a return into the net and De Minaur closed out the win.

Fellow Briton, Cameron Norrie, pulled out of the tournament with a knee injury but is expected to be fit enough for the Davis Cup Finals on 23 November.

"Men's Ballon d'Or: Lionel Messi wins eighth award, beating Erling Haaland to trophy",[],,0.9978,Uplifting,"Last updated on .From the section European Football

Argentina and Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi has won the Men's Ballon d'Or for an eighth time.

The 36-year-old was recognised at the ceremony in Paris after helping his country win the World Cup in Qatar last year.

England and Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham won the Kopa Trophy for the world's best player aged under 21.

Messi won his record-extending Ballon d'Or award ahead of Manchester City forward Erling Haaland.

France forward Kylian Mbappe - who became just the second man to score a World Cup final hat-trick in the 4-2 penalty shootout loss to Argentina - finished third.

""It's nice to be here once more to enjoy this moment,"" Messi said. ""To be able to win the World Cup and achieve my dream.""

The former Barcelona and Paris St-Germain star added: ""I couldn't imagine having the career I've had and everything I've achieved, the fortune I've had to be part of the best team in history.

""All of them [Ballon d'Or awards] are special for different reasons.""

Lionel Messi has won the Ballon d'Or more than any other footballer

Norway international Haaland scored a record-breaking 36 goals in 35 league games and hit 52 in all competitions as City won the Treble of Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup.

He was recognised for his achievements with the Gerd Muller Trophy for best goalscorer.

""I want to thank Manchester City, the whole club,"" said Haaland.

""I also want to thank my family and all the people around me for making me who I am today.""

Messi moves further out in front of the rest

The Ballon d'Or recognises the best footballer of the year and is voted for by 100 journalists from around the world.

As well as helping Argentina to World Cup glory, Messi also played a key role as Inter Miami won their first trophy - the Leagues Cup - and has scored 11 goals in 14 appearances for the Major League Soccer side.

He has now won three more Ballon d'Or awards than anyone else, with Cristiano Ronaldo having won it five times, most recently in 2017.

The Portugal international, who plays for Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia, was not named on the shortlist for the first time since 2003.

Martinez recognised as world's best goalkeeper

Argentina World Cup winner and Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez won the Yashin Trophy for the best goalkeeper in the world.

Martinez won the Golden Glove in Qatar, saving a spot-kick from Kingsley Coman in the penalty shootout win against France in the final.

He also helped Aston Villa finish seventh in the Premier League and secure a place in the Europa Conference League.

However, Martinez was jeered by some of the crowd at the Paris ceremony. The goalkeeper was criticised for this celebration after winning the World Cup against France last year.

Manchester City win club of year award

Manchester City were named the club of the year at the awards for the second year running.

Pep Guardiola's side became only the second English team to win the Treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup last season.

They had seven players shortlisted for the men's Ballon d'Or award.

Vinicius Jr recognised as he vows to fight against racism

Real Madrid winger Vinicius Jr received the Socrates Award for his contribution off the field and vowed to keep speaking out against racism in world football.

Vinicius has been the target of racist abuse regularly in La Liga games for the past two seasons.

He was recognised for starting a foundation that is building schools in impoverished areas and investing in education in Brazil.

""I will remain strong in the fight against racism,"" said the Brazilian. ""It is a very sad thing to talk about racism nowadays, but we have to continue in the fight so that people suffer less.""

Beckham pays tribute to Sir Bobby Charlton

Former England and Manchester United midfielder David Beckham presented the men's Ballon d'Or to Messi, but before announcing the winner he paid tribute to Sir Bobby Charlton.

The England World Cup winner died at the age of 86 earlier this month.

""I probably don't have to tell this room how special Sir Bobby was to the world of football,"" Beckham said.

""He was respected on the field for what he won but was respected even more off the field for what he stood for.

""He will be missed. When we looked up into the stands he would always be there cheering us on.

""He started it off for me. If it was not for Sir Bobby turning around to Manchester United and saying 'watch this young man' I probably would not have played for Manchester United.

""I owe him everything.""

Women's Ballon d'Or: Spain and Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati wins award for first time,[],,0.9978,Uplifting,"Last updated on .From the section European Football

Spain and Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati has won the Women's Ballon d'Or for the first time.

The 25-year-old enjoyed a hugely successful year as she helped her club triumph in the Spanish top flight and Champions League, and her country win the World Cup in the summer.

She was also crowned Uefa's player of the year in August.

England goalkeeper Mary Earps achieved a fifth place finish while team-mate Rachel Daly was 10th.

Fellow Lionesses Millie Bright and Georgia Stanway were also among the nominees.

Sam Kerr of Chelsea and Australia finished second, Barcelona and Spain teenager Salma Paralluelo was third, and Fridolina Rolfo of Barcelona and Sweden finished fourth.

""I'm very proud to win the Ballon d'Or,"" Bonmati said.

""Football is a collective sport so I'd like to extend this prize to my team-mates and staff.""

Aitana Bonmati won the award at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in Paris

She added at the end of her speech in English: ""Finally congratulations to the other nominees. They're great footballers.

""As role models we have a responsibility on and off the pitch. We should be more than athletes and keep leading by example and fighting together for a better, peaceful and equal world.""

Spain's World Cup win was overshadowed by the fallout from Spanish football federation president Luis Rubiales kissing Jenni Hermoso after the final, which she said was not consensual.

Eddie Jones: Australia head coach resigns following early Rugby World Cup exit,[],,0.5692,Good,"Last updated on .From the section Rugby Union

Eddie Jones succeeded Dave Rennie as Australia head coach in January

Eddie Jones has stepped down from his position as head coach of Australia.

The Wallabies exited the recent Rugby World Cup in the pool stage - the first time in the tournament's history they failed to reach the knockout stage.

Jones, who began a second spell in charge of the team in January, will officially step down on 25 November.

In a statement, Rugby Australia thanked Jones, 63, for his ""commitment to the Wallabies in 2023"" and wished him ""the best in his future endeavours"".

The statement added an announcement over the future of Australia's coaching staff would be made ""in due course"".

Jones was sacked by England just one month before taking on the role as Wallabies head coach, succeeding Dave Rennie. He signed a contract running through to 2027 - the year Australia hosts the next Rugby World Cup.

During this year's tournament, Jones denied speculation linking him with a return as Japan coach, insisting he was ""committed"" to his role with Australia.

It had been reported external-link he was interviewed by Japan, whom he coached from 2012 to 2015, days before Australia began their World Cup campaign.

The Australian, whose mother and wife are Japanese, said he had ""no idea"" where the story came from, adding: ""I haven't spoken to anyone.""

Jones had led Australia and England to World Cup finals in 2003 and 2019 respectively, but his sides lost on both occasions.

He told the Sydney Morning Herald on Sunday: ""(I) gave it a run. Hopefully (I'll) be the catalyst for change.""

Australia were upset by Fiji and lost heavily to Wales in a disappointing 2023 campaign, eventually finishing third in their pool.

They won only two of their nine Tests after Jones' return - against tier-two nations Georgia and Portugal at the World Cup.

The announcement comes after Rugby Australia led an independent review into the team's performance at the World Cup.

Rugby Australia chief executive Phil Waugh is set to hold a media conference on Tuesday to address the fall-out from Jones' forthcoming departure.

Chairman of Rugby Australia Hamish McLennan, who played a key role in getting Jones to return to the side for a second stint, said he would not quit following the disappointing World Cup campaign.

McLennan told the Sydney Morning Herald: ""I came to rugby to find a way to fix it when it all fell over and despite the sad Eddie situation, this is another hurdle we'll overcome.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/67254778?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
Ballon d'Or: Jude Bellingham wins Kopa Trophy for world's best young player,[],,0.9984,Uplifting,"Last updated on .From the section European Football

England and Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham has won the Kopa Trophy for the world's best player aged under 21.

The 20-year-old was recognised at Monday's Ballon d'Or ceremony in Paris.

Bellingham has enjoyed a stunning start to his career at Real Madrid, scoring 13 goals in his first 13 games since joining in the summer.

The Kopa Trophy recognises his performances last season, during which he scored 14 times in 42 games for Borussia Dortmund.

He also helped England reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Qatar.

Bellingham was picked ahead of Bayern Munich's Jamal Musiala, with former winners - Barcelona pair Gavi and Pedri - as well as Real team-mate Eduardo Camavinga also up for the award.

He said: ""It is a great list of players [to have won this award before].

""It is an honour to be in front of some of the best players in the world here and some of the best to have ever played the game.

""To win this trophy means a lot but for me the important thing is team trophies and the important thing for me is to kick on and help Real Madrid and England win trophies for many years.""

'He's just going to get better and better'

Former Premier League striker Chris Sutton described Bellingham as ""the most exciting prospect"" he has witnessed in his lifetime.

He told BBC Radio 5 live's Monday Night Club: ""Going to Real Madrid as a 20-year-old and going alongside legends of the game like Luka Modric and just bossing it, just taking everything in his stride.

""He makes things look so easy. I remember watching Gazza play at Carrow Road and it was like he was playing in his back garden, miles ahead of anything else on the pitch. That's what it's like watching Bellingham, it's just so easy.

""I think he's probably the most exciting prospect I can remember in my lifetime for one so young coming through. He's just going to carry on developing and getting better and better.""

Coventry City 0-2 West Brom: Carlos Corberan's Baggies seal derby win,[],,0.9991,Uplifting,"Last updated on .From the section Championship

Brandon Thomas-Asante kept his cool to double West Brom's lead

West Bromwich Albion climbed back into the Championship top six as they scored a goal in each half to deservedly win a Midlands derby against lacklustre Coventry City.

Grady Diangana put the Baggies ahead on 17 minutes when he slid home from close range after Coventry keeper Ben Wilson parried the ball to him.

Matt Phillips then brilliantly set up Brandon Thomas-Asante for a superb second goal as Albion went route one to finish off the hosts.

Coventry striker Haji Wright had earlier wasted a great chance to equalise when through on goal, but there was nothing else left in the tank from the Sky Blues as they slid to a third straight league defeat.

It leaves Mark Robins' side still 20th, although only eight points behind fifth-placed Albion in a table that remains as tight as ever in this competitive division.

Albion made two changes from last Tuesday's 2-0 home win over Queens Park Rangers, but defender Cedric Kipre was surprisingly named in the starting XI.

Boss Carlos Corberan had expected Kipre to be out ""for months"" after limping off late on against QPR, but scans gave him the all clear.

Injury-hit Albion's alterations came further up the pitch, with Pipa coming in at right wing-back for Darnell Furlong and Alex Mowatt recalled in a tactical reshuffle that led to Thomas-Asante starting on the bench.

City boss Mark Robins, by way of contrast, made five changes from the 2-0 defeat at Rotherham, bringing back Bobby Thomas and Liam Kitching in defence and restoring Jamie Allen, Tatsuhiro Sakamoto and Haji Wright further forward.

Albion skipper Jed Wallace was on hand to celebrate Grady Diangana's second goal in successive matches

Although they had marginally the better of the first half, it did not quite click for the Sky Blues in front of goal.

Sakamoto had a powerful shot beaten away by Palmer before Coventry were out of luck with a penalty shout for handball.

Albion then stunned the hosts by taking the lead when Wilson spilled Nathaniel Chalobah's shot - and Diangana was on hand to find the back of the net.

He now has goals in successive games, having not previously scored since February's win against Coventry at The Hawthorns.

Despite a lot of possession in and around the Baggies box, City had nothing to show for it.

They did have one glorious chance on 51 minutes when USA striker Wright went clear, only to fire the wrong side of the post.

But the three points were sealed on 69 minutes when Phillips delivered a stunning ball down the left flank with the outside of his right foot to send Thomas-Asante clear, down the inside-left channel and Wilson was left rooted to the spot as he delivered a superb finish with his right instep.

Despite concerns among home fans that he might have been offside, Thomas-Asante appeared to time his run to perfection, the flag stayed down - and he ruthlessly buried his fifth goal of the season and, like Diangana, his second in successive games.

Who's next?

Coventry now face a daunting trip to Preston on Saturday to play their bogey side, who they have not beaten in a run of 19 league meetings, stretching back to their last win over North End in September 2007.

Albion have a home game against seventh-placed Hull City, one of three sides around them all on 23 points.

Coventry City manager Mark Robins told BBC CWR:

""There's no other way out of it than sticking together and not lose belief. I'm experienced to know that sometimes this is what happens in football. And I've told the players not to get too down.

""The supporters were brilliant. We just have to get through this. If I start to panic about the results, then we will have a problem.

""We've given them the opportunity to score. That's got to stop. But we created really good chances and we have to take more opportunities to shoot. That is down to the confidence of the players, but it will come.""

West Bromwich Albion head coach Carlo Corberan told BBC Radio WM:

""I am happy with the result. When I see the team competing like this, it is reward for the fans.

""The most injuries we have are attacking injuries. It was important that Kipre was not injured.

""The only message we have is to ourselves - to keep winning, keep improving in defence and attack and keep growing as a team.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/67190846?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
BBC Women's Footballer of the Year 2023: Will Fridolina Rolfo get your vote?,[],,0.9989,Uplifting,"BBC Women's Footballer of the Year 2023: Fridolina Rolfö profile

Age: 29 Position: Forward/full-back Teams: Barcelona and Sweden

Fridolina Rolfo is used to starring on the biggest stages and she did so once again in June, scoring the winner as Barcelona came from 2-0 down to beat Wolfsburg 3-2 and win the Champions League in Eindhoven.

It was third time lucky for the Swede, who previously found herself on the losing side in the European showpiece for both Barca and former club Wolfsburg.

The Swedish forward is versatile, with Barcelona deploying her in a defensive role last season, her work helping the side to storm to a Liga F triumph, finishing 10 points clear of runners-up Real Madrid.

And when Sweden faced a penalty shootout against reigning champions the USA in the last 16 of the World Cup, she stood up to take the first kick as they earned a victory that ensured an early exit for one of the favourites.

Sweden lost to eventual winners Spain in the semis, but Rolfo took home a bronze medal and scored three goals across the tournament, including in the third-place play-off as they triumphed over co-hosts Australia.

Rolfo in her own words

How did it feel to score the winner in the Champions League final?

""That was a special one for me - as a defender it's not often I'm scoring goals. Suddenly it was in front of my feet and I was looking where should I put the ball and it was a good goal - maybe the most important goal in my career.

""In the first half we were so disappointed with the result because we had the ball but couldn't score.

""I remember everyone saying we have to believe, because it is possible we can score three goals and that's what we did.

""The mental part at half-time was really important and we showed how good we can be.""

What does she remember about beating the USA on penalties in the World Cup?

""This memory is one of those that will stay with me as long as I live, especially the last penalty kick. I couldn't watch it.

""When Lina (Hurtig) was stepping up to shoot, I was so nervous. I couldn't watch because I knew how important it was and how much we wanted to reach the next stage.

""I felt really calm [for my penalty], I was not that nervous. The coach was asking who wanted to be the first one and I said I wanted to start.

""I was sure I wanted to take the first one. I believe in my team-mates but [then] you can't do anything, you're just standing there, nervous.""

Did she dream of being a footballer?

""When I think back to when I was younger, I didn't dream about being a footballer. I [didn't think] it was a job you could have, you could not live on it.

""I thought that it was only boys [that] could have those dreams.

""But so much has happened and if I knew how far you could reach as a football player, I would be crazy proud of my whole journey because it's been amazing.

""I never thought I could live this dream that I'm living at the moment.""

Who were her footballing role models?

""My biggest role model was (Brazilian footballer) Marta. She came to Sweden when she was really young and started her professional career there.

""She was so, so different in her technique, speed, dribbling. She was my biggest role model. I even named my cat after her, so she was a big part of me growing up, having someone to look up to.

""I remember my mum took me to women's games, they were maybe not that popular, but she was like 'we should watch women, it's something you can identify with'.""

'She has an incredible mentality'

Barcelona captain Alexia Putellas: ""She understands how we play and how to win. She is very motivated and cares about helping the team, everyone can see that.

""Fridolina is fantastic. She has tremendous energy, a great shot and many qualities. We are lucky to have those qualities in our team.""

Barcelona team-mate Lucy Bronze, speaking after their Champions League final success: ""She's been incredible for us all season in a role that's a little different.

""She shows that she has an incredible mentality when she comes in and performs in the most important game of the year.""

Achievements of 2022-23

What else should you know?

She is naturally a forward - but often plays as a full-back for Barcelona

At the start of her career she juggled playing with working at a bank

Rolfo has won two Olympic silver medals

She loves handball, which she played until she was 15, and is an ambassador for the European Handball Championships in Germany in January

Adam Johnson: Neck guards to be made mandatory in England after ice hockey player's death,[],,0.9929,Uplifting,"Floral tributes have been left outside Nottingham Panthers' Motorpoint Arena following the death of Adam Johnson

The English Ice Hockey Association says it will be mandatory to wear a neck guard during ""all on-ice activities"" from 2024 onwards.

The announcement comes following the death of Nottingham Panthers forward Adam Johnson.

Johnson died after suffering a serious cut to his neck from a skate during Saturday's Challenge Cup match against the Sheffield Steelers.

BBC Sport understands Johnson was not wearing a neck guard.

Players in the UK are allowed to play without neck guards once they turn 18.

The English Ice Hockey Association (EIHA), which oversees all levels of ice hockey in the England below the Elite League - the top division of ice hockey in the UK which Johnson played in - also said their ""strong recommendation"" is that all players wear neck guards with immediate effect, to ""ensure that a tragic incident of this nature never befalls our sport again"".

It is unclear whether the Elite League will also adopt the EIHA's guidelines.

""It is unacceptable for any player to lose their life while playing sport,"" said the EIHA.

""Our responsibility is not only to avert the recurrence of such a heart-breaking accident, but also to pre-emptively address other foreseeable incidents in the future.

""We bear both a legal and a moral obligation to respond in a measured and pragmatic way. There is a distinct likelihood that comprehensive evaluations will transpire at the international level, and the EIHA is committed to taking an active and constructive role in this process.""

The EIHA said neck guards are not immediately mandatory because of ""anticipated supply issues"". They also said a full review of all player safety equipment will take place over the next 12 months.

Scottish Ice Hockey and Ice Hockey UK - which runs the Great Britain national team - already make neck guards mandatory.

Ice Hockey UK has said it will ""extend the existing International Ice Hockey Federation recommendation, and mandate until further notice, that all players at all levels across the GB representative teams use an approved Ice Hockey Neck Guard/Protector whilst participating in all on ice activities with GB"".

The body will also conduct a thorough player health, safety and wellbeing review, adding: ""It is deeply regrettable that any player loses their life playing our sport, and it is incumbent upon us as the National Governing Body for the sport to do all we can to prevent a repeat of this tragic accident, but also to prevent other foreseeable incidents in the future.

""We have a moral and legal duty to respond in a measured and reasonable way.""

Johnson's fiancee paid tribute to her ""sweet angel"" on Monday as police continue to investigate his death.

'Incredible tragedy'

Tributes have continued to be paid to Johnson following the incident with Mike Sullivan, his former coach at NHL team the Pittsburgh Penguins, saying it is an ""incredible tragedy"".

""I don't know if I have words to explain the whole circumstance,"" he said.

""He's a terrific kid. It was a privilege to be his coach. I remember when he first came to our development camp, that was my first experience watching him play and boy, could he really skate.""

Johnson played in 13 NHL games over two seasons from 2018-20 with the Penguins and his former teammate and Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby offered his ""thoughts and prayers"" to Johnson's family.

""It's something that we've all been thinking about since finding out,"" Crosby said.

""He's just a great guy, great teammate. An awesome attitude when he was here and was just generally happy to be playing in the NHL. It's heartbreaking that that's happened.""

Coach addresses fans after ice hockey player's death

Neck guard stigma 'needs to change'

Attitudes towards neck guards in ice hockey ""need to change"" following Johnson's death, according to Great Britain international Abbie Culshaw.

Before the EIHA announcement, English third-tier side Oxford City Stars said they would make neck protection mandatory for their players and staff.

""They're considered annoying and if you've got a neck guard you're still seen as like a junior,"" Culshaw - also a forward for Whitley Bay and the Bradford Bulldogs - said.

Asked by BBC Newsbeat about the stigma of wearing neck protection, she added players would ""wind up"" or ""call out"" others for wearing a guard, and ""belittle"" them.

""Some people do wear them for their own safety but the majority of people don't if they don't have to,"" she said.

""It does bug you and it irritates your neck. So as soon as people are 18 they can't wait to get rid of it. I hope for everyone's sake that what has happened has changed what people think.

""Then it just becomes this common thing, that people have them on and it's not seen as like a segregation from the men to the juniors. I hope it does change because it needs to.""

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Oxford City Stars director of hockey operations Shane Moore said: ""When you come to 18 there's a stigma around wearing your neck guard and face cage, it's almost like to be a man you have to remove those.

""It's not the right way to be, player safety must come first.

""The skates are sharp and that's why the neck guards are so important.""

What are the rules on neck guards around the world?

Compulsory guards are already in place in the likes of Finland and Sweden, while Germany's top flight, the Deutsche Eishockey Liga, is also reportedly considering their introduction external-link for the new season.

USA Hockey has also previously recommended external-link their blanket use due to concerns about ""neck lacerations and the potential catastrophic involvement of arteries, veins and nerves"".

However, current regulations mean they are not obligatory across all leagues.

Oxford City Stars, who have former Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech on their roster and compete in the National Ice Hockey League South Division One, hope their announcement will push ""for enhanced safety standards across the sport"".

In a statement they added: ""We encourage other clubs to also offer these neck guards to their players. At our level of play, we strongly believe that these guards should be worn by all players.""

Analysis - should neck guards be obligatory?

Ice hockey commentator Seth Bennett, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live

It was just a moment that has left the sport globally devastated. It was an incident that you hope you never ever have to see.

Ice hockey is a very big family sport and there will be a lot of kids asking a lot of questions and trying to come to terms with what they saw on Saturday evening.

I think there will be a conversation at league level but they are governed by the international Ice Hockey Federation and they have not made great moves to improve safety in this particular aspect because it happens so very rarely.

At 18 players ditch their neck guards and full face masks and go to wearing half visors and when you sit here after such an awful event, you shrug your shoulders and say 'why?'.

But if you put it down to a players vote right now not very many would be voting to wear a neck guard in their next game.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/ice-hockey/67260326?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.

Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also sent troops and tanks into the territory.

What is Israel's action in Gaza?

Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said ground forces had gone into Gaza to ""dismantle"" Hamas and bring hostages home.

On Monday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had ""killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and attempted to attack the troops"".

The IDF said it had continued to strike hundreds of Hamas targets from the air.

It said that in one attack, an aircraft was guided by forces on the ground and struck a building ""with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside it"".

A fighter jet also struck a military post used to launch anti-tank missiles near Al-Azhar University in northern Gaza, the IDF added.

Israeli armoured vehicles have been seen near Gaza City, on the main road running north to south in the Gaza Strip. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show a tank on the road firing at a car, followed by an explosion.

The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for Al-Quds hospital in northern Gaza, but that it was impossible to move hundreds of the patients who are being treated there.

Eyewitnesses have described heavy shelling around the hospital, where 14,000 people are thought to be sheltering.

The Israeli military has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along Gaza's perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists alongside its standing force of 160,000.

Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 members in its military wing. It also has a network of underground tunnels across Gaza, connecting its command centres, which it has said stretch for 500km (310 miles).

On Monday, Hamas released a video showing three people held hostage in Gaza. Although BBC News does not know about the conditions under which it was filmed, the three women appear to be in reasonable health with no obvious signs of injury.

More on Israel-Gaza war

What is the humanitarian situation in Gaza?

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said thousands of Gaza residents had broken into its distribution centres and warehouses ""taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies"".

The UN also said many children now have only salty water to drink.

The World Health Organization has said Gaza's hospitals are barely functioning due to shortages of electricity and supplies.

Over the weekend, dozens more lorries carrying aid supplies entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.

However, Gaza normally receives 500 lorry-loads of supplies a day.

US President Joe Biden has told Israel that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased.

There have also been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations, and the sewerage system.

Israel has refused to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also said that Hamas is hoarding hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that it is refusing to hand over to aid agencies.

The Israeli military has ordered people leaving in northern areas to evacuate for their own safety, and 1.4 million people have since moved south.

The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents. About 600,000 are being hosted by Unrwa.

What is Hamas and what does it want?

Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state.

Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks.

In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.

Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.

Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers.

Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.

Why is this happening now?

Image source, Oren Rosenfeld Image caption, Hamas killed families in their homes in the kibbutz of Kfar Aza

On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders.

It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.

The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.

Mr Netanyahu said after the attack that Israel was at war, and vowed that Hamas would ""pay an unprecedented price"".

Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.

It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.

This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.

Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.

The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

The Israeli military says 229 people are still being held in Gaza.

They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.

Hamas has so far returnedfour hostages, with the Gulf state of Qatar acting as a mediator for their release.

What is the Gaza Strip and who lives there?

The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.

Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.

Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.

It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world.

Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip.

Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.

What is Palestine?

The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.

These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland.

Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist.

Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.

When should I turn the heating on?,[],,0.9952,Uplifting,"Click to expand

When should I turn the heating on? The temperature is dropping again, and many of us are reaching for our cosy jumpers and winter duvets. So when is the best time to turn on your heating? And what else can you do to keep your home warm? Here's what you need to know as we head into winter.

When should you turn your heating on? The best time in the year to turn on your heating in the UK is hotly debated. But most experts agree that it is when the temperature drops consistently, as the nights get longer and the clocks go back. This year that fell on Sunday 29 October.

Should you keep your heating on all day? The Energy Saving Trust is clear on this one: leaving a boiler on for longer will cost more. It's better to just have it on when you need it. The Met Office, which measures temperatures and weather for the UK, recommends setting timers to turn the heating on before you get up and off after you've gone to bed. If no one is at home all day then you can have it turn off before you leave and on again just before you get back.

What temperature should my boiler be? Both the Met Office and the Energy Saving Trust say it will cost more in energy bills to turn the heating up than to leave it on for longer. Set your thermostat between 18C and 21C, or up to 23C if you have ill or vulnerable people at home. Bedrooms can be slightly cooler, and the NHS recommends 16C to 20C for babies' bedrooms. This is different from the boiler temperature, which is the temperature of water inside the pipes themselves. That shouldn't go below 65C on a regular boiler to stop bacteria growing inside, according to the Energy Saving Trust, or 60C on a combi boiler.

Does turning down radiators save money? Most radiators have controls on the side to change the temperature. If used correctly, these thermostatic radiator valves - often numbered one to five (sometimes up to six) - can save you money. The numbers don't mean specific temperatures, but the Energy Saving Trust recommends setting them at three or four to start, and then go up or down if the room is too hot or too cold.

Does bleeding your radiators save money? Bleeding your radiators saves money by removing air bubbles which make it slower to heat up your home. Experts say you should aim to bleed your radiators every year as it starts to get cold. When the radiator is cold, use a screwdriver or radiator key to turn the valve at the top, until you hear a hissing noise. Hold an old cloth to the valve in case any water comes out. All the air bubbles are gone when the hissing stops and you can close the valve again.

Heat the rooms you use often and forget the rest If you're worried about bills, stick to heating the rooms you use the most by using the radiator controls. Don't forget to close the door on the rooms you're leaving cold and think about getting draught excluders to keep your rooms extra snug.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67197871?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Annual energy bills are falling in October, but prices remain much higher than in recent years.

Some of those struggling to pay have been forced onto more expensive prepayment meters, prompting energy regulator Ofgem to strengthen rules to protect consumers.

What is happening to energy bills?

The government launched its Energy Price Guarantee in October 2022. It replaced the previous Ofgem energy price cap, and limited a typical dual-fuel household's annual energy bill to £2,500.

This remained in place until the end of June 2023, when the Ofgem cap was reinstated, at which point a typical annual energy bill fell to £2,074.

Under the latest price cap, typical annual bills will fall to around £1,923 between October and December.

What happens if you don't pay your bill?

If you don't agree a payment plan with your supplier, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed, or they may switch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode.

In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection, but you'll normally be offered a meter first.

If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either:

live alone

live only with pensioners, or under-18s

Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this.

Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments.

Paying by direct debit is normally the cheapest way to pay for electricity and gas. Cancelling a direct debit means future bills are likely to be higher.

Non-payment could also damage your credit rating, and make it harder to borrow money.

What are the rules about prepayment meters?

The regulator Ofgem reviewed the use of prepayment meters after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters.

Under new rules, suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a ""site welfare visit"".

In addition meters cannot be fitted for:

customers over 85, without someone else in the house, or anyone with a terminal illness

those with health conditions which could be worsened by living in a cold home, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema and sickle cell disease

those who need a continuous energy supply for health reasons

households where no one can top up the meter due to physical or mental incapacity

Those forced onto a prepayment meter will get £30 initial credit to reduce the risk of them losing supply.

The government has said prepayment energy charges will be cut, bringing them in line with direct debit rates.

Suppliers have also been told to identify households where meters were wrongfully installed, return the customer to their previous tariff and offer compensation.

What should you do if you can't afford your bills?

Check your direct debit

Your monthly payment is based on your estimated energy use for the year, and your supplier may reduce your bill if its estimate is higher than the amount you actually use.

You can also request a flexible monthly direct debit where you only pay for your actual consumption. This requires a smart meter or regular readings.

However, two-thirds of gas usage is during the winter months, so make sure you understand the impact of reducing payments during warmer weather.

Pay what you can

If the direct debit is fair, but you can't meet it, ask your supplier for an ""able to pay plan"" based on what you can afford.

By paying something every month - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears grow more slowly, and your supplier may be less worried about your debt.

You may be able to get your name added to the Priority Services Register (PSR), a list of households entitled to extra support.

Those eligible include pensioners, pregnant women, parents of young children, and people who are disabled.

Ofgem also recommends asking your supplier to add your name to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on your energy supply for medical reasons.

If you have different gas and electricity suppliers, you need to contact them both.

Being on the PSR doesn't cancel your arrears. But it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account.

Claim any relevant benefits

The independent MoneyHelper website has a useful guide to available benefits, while Policy in Practice and the charities Entitledto and Turn2us run benefits calculators.

You may also be able to repay your debt directly from your benefits through the government's Fuel Direct scheme.

A number of suppliers and charities also offer hardship grants.

Check you're getting extra government help

There is a range of government support to help with energy bills, available to households on means-tested benefits, pensioners and people on certain disability benefits.

The next payments for some eligible groups will be made between 31 October and 19 November.

Adjust your boiler

If you have a combi boiler at home - you don't have a hot water cylinder and there is a (usually white) plastic pipe under the boiler - you may wish to consider turning down the heating flow temperature.

On the front - sometimes behind a flap - look for a dial or set of buttons with a radiator icon. Turn the dial to the number three, or the 12 o'clock position. If it has a digital display, select 60C.

You may also want to turn off the hot water pre-heat. Many boilers come on every few hours - night and day - to ensure there's always some hot water available.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62435432?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Food prices: How can I save money on my grocery shop?,[],,0.9971,Uplifting,"Food prices: How can I save money on my grocery shop? Published 5 days ago

As price rises bite into budgets, many people are cutting back on the weekly food shop.

As well as buying less, people are looking for ways to make their money go further and to make the most of what they have. The BBC spoke to money bloggers for their tried and tested tips.

1. Keep track of what you already have

Rosie suggests taking a good look at your cupboards before each shopping trip. ""We all know the value of making a list, but if you're adding to what you've already got in your cupboards, then you're going to spend money on things you don't need,"" she says.

""There's no point in buying more jars of pasta sauce if you've already got five of them in the cupboard.""

Image source, Rosie Forshaw Image caption, Rosie Forshaw has cut her food shop down to £40 a week

She keeps a list of what's in her cupboards in a notebook, so she always knows what she already has when she goes shopping. She says it has helped bring her weekly food shop for her, her husband and one-year-old son down to around £40.

2. Head for the reduced section first

Lynn recommends changing how you shop when you walk into a store and to head straight for the reduced section. ""If you spot something there that's on your list, you can tick that off and you've already saved some money,"" she says.

She suggests then going straight to the frozen-foods section, and then the canned-produce aisle.

""Frozen meat, fish and vegetables will almost always be cheaper than the fresh option,"" she says. ""If you get what you need from there before going on to the fresh produce aisles, you're likely to make significant savings.""

3. Make better use of your freezer

According to sustainability charity Wrap, the average household wastes around £700 every year by throwing food away. Lynn says making better use of her freezer has helped her cut down dramatically on waste.

""If things are getting close to their use-by date you should always try to freeze them,"" she says. ""Things like milk and cheese, even fruit and vegetables, can all be frozen and kept for when you need them.""

Image source, Kate Hall Image caption, Kate Hall says freezing food can make it last

More on the basics of freezing can be found on the Food Standards Agency website.

Kate Hall, who runs The Full Freezer website, uses her freezer as a pause button rather than a long-term storage solution. She says that while almost all foods can be frozen, you do have to change the way you use them.

""You can't defrost a banana or salad and expect it to be the same as when it went into the freezer,"" she explains. ""But if you think about how you could use it in puddings or in soups or in casseroles, then you're going to save a lot of money.""

4. Understand packaging

Rosie says that a lot of what we buy in the supermarket is packaged for their convenience and not ours. ""How often have you bought a tray of mushrooms covered in cling film only to have them go off in their packaging? They're wrapped up like that to make them easier to transport,"" she explains.

She puts hers in a paper bag when she gets them home but says just taking off the plastic wrapping will help them last longer.

Helen White, from Wrap, which runs the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, says there are small things we can do to make food last longer, especially fresh vegetables and salads - the UK's most wasted food group.

""Just putting a piece of kitchen roll into an open bag of salad to absorb moisture is going to help it last longer,"" she says.

Keeping fruit in the fridge will help it last longer, but she suggests checking that the temperature is set to below 5°C. ""We think millions of UK fridges are at least two degrees too warm,"" she says. ""This is bad news for milk and other food items kept in the fridge, which can go off [more quickly] when not stored at the right temperature.""

5. Make use of experts

Rosie tries to use local, smaller retailers a lot to tap into their years of experience.

""Butchers are a great resource and someone we shouldn't be afraid to talk to about saving money,"" she says. ""If you go into your local butcher and tell them you've only got £8 for your meat for the week, they'll be able to tell you how to stretch your money by buying the cheapest cuts.

""They're the best people to advise on how to cook them and how to make them go further.""

We asked you for your tips, here are some you sent in:

My wife and I sit with our iPads on both Asda and Tesco and put in the exact same things for our weekly delivery. We then check at the end total costs including delivery and whoever is cheapest 'wins' our order. We feel that writing a list of things you need then getting them online saves going to the shop where we would invariably end up throwing things in that we don't need. Russell, Portstewart, Northern Ireland

I highly recommend having a weekly menu, so you know what you are going to cook/prepare for your meals each week. I post this on our fridge and our family of five always knows what to expect. This not only saves money but eliminates the stress of ""what's for dinner""? I know exactly what I need to get, and I stick to my budget because I go to the supermarket with a plan, plus I check the fridge/pantry before I go shopping. Michelle Lutchman, Surrey

Tip is not about food but about cleaning products. There is much money to be saved on laundry and cleaning products. These are full of gimmicks to make us buy additional stuff. For instance, you don't need separate washing powder for coloureds. Fading is largely due to exposure to daylight rather than brighteners in washing powder. Helen Borodzicz, Lytham, St Annes

I go to the supermarket at about 2.30 pm when they are reducing sandwiches - that's my tea sorted! Sue Tingey, Wiltshire
